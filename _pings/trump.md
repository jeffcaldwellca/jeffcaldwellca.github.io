Mark my words, Trump tries to keep the US out of the expanding war until he’s nearing end of his term. Then “swoops in like a white knight because only the US can save the world!”  sinking the US offcially into it, and claiming “oh democracies don’t have elections during wartime...your boy Zelenskyy, that you love so much, has used the same steps and you all supported him!” 

Except trump is a corrupt fuckwit and uses it to extend his power for as long as he can hold onto it not giving a fuck if after a few more years the world is fucked cause he’ll be dead anyway.

Uses it as an excuse to have more troops in Greenland as a staging ground, then claims they can’t keep it safe and annexes them for the “security of the northern channel” ... maybe not by land grabbing fully... maybe even just by controlling a puppet government (Belarus to RUS is a good example)

Oh and as part of joining in, he demands payment from Europe for “coming to their rescue in spite of it hurting our struggling economy”

Putin taught him how to do it, Musk and Theil and others are his oligarchs
